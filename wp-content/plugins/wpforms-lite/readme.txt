> Bill Erickson - Expert WordPress Consultant

= Pre-built Form Templates =

Building contact forms in WordPress can be time consuming. Why?

Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it's often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.

Whether you're looking to create a simple contact form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.

WPForms comes with <a href="https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">pre-built form templates</a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.

= Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed =

WPForms' contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed - Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugin.

You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugin.

= All the Fields & Features that You Need to Succeed =

From radio buttons to file uploads to multi-page contact forms, we have all the fields you need.

You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.

The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.

See what one business owner has to say about WPForms' contact form:

>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allow me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag & drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br>
> David Henzel - Co-founder of MaxCDN

= Surveys & Polls =

Along with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.

Our <a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">WordPress Survey plugin addon</a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more.

WPForms offer the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.

The best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form created with WPForms.

You can also use the surveys & polls addon to easily create a poll on your site. Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.

Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.

= Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More =

While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, and more.

WPForms integrates with both PayPal and Stripe to make it easy for you to accept credit card payments online. It even comes with a signature field to collect user signature on your WordPress forms.

You can do all of this while still using the same easy-to-use contact form builder that's loved by over 1 million users.

>I am so impressed with this plugin. I decided to give it a shot over some of the other form plugins, and I am so glad I did. It works well, is so easy to use and customize. The support is amazing on top of it all. I got the pro version because I was so pleased. Highly recommend.<br>
> Micky73 - WordPress user

= Easy to Customize and Extend =

You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, an custom CSS.

We also knew that our developer friends may want to extend contact forms further. That's why WPForms come with tons of hooks and filters to create custom functionality.
