In this Privacy Policy, "we", "us" and "our" refers to: [forum-name].

This is privacy policy sets out how [forum-name] uses and protects any information that you provide, whilst using [forum-name] products and services. This only includes [forum-name] ( [forum-url] ) .

<h2>1. What information we collect about you and how we use this information</h2>
<h3>1.1 Account and Profile Information</h3>
You don’t have to create an account to use this forum, such as searching and viewing public member profiles, forums, topics and posts. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, "John Doe"), nickname (for example, @john-doe) a username (for example, johnxdoe), a password, and an email address. Your display name and nickname is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. After the registration your account display name, nickname and username are the same. We recommend to change display name and nickname to keep the username private and secure. You can change those in your account editing page.

Once you registered and created an account, you also have the option of adding these public information:
<ul>
    <li>Member Title</li>
    <li>Avatar</li>
    <li>Biography (About Me)</li>
    <li>Website</li>
    <li>Occupation</li>
    <li>Signature</li>
    <li>Social Network Account addresses</li>
    <li>Location (Country)</li>
    <li>Timezon</li>
    <li>And other details to your profile information to be displayed in our community.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, whilst using the [forum-name] the following information may be collected (not public):
<ul>

    <li>Geographical location</li>

    <li>Operating system (not public)</li>
    <li>Referral source (not public)</li>
    <li>Length of visit, page views, website navigation and any other related browsing activity</li>
</ul>
Most activity on [forum-name] is public, including your profile information mentioned above. You also may choose to publish your location in your profile. Information posted about you by other people who use our forum may also be public. For example, other people may mention you using @nickname in posts.

You are responsible for your topics, posts and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information.

You may choose to register connecting your account to accounts on another service (e.g. Facebook login), and that other service may send us information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our community. We create new account in our community for you based on your third party account information you share.
<h3>1.2 Contact Information</h3>
We use your contact information, such as your email address, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse.

You can also unsubscribe from any email notifications.

If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.
<h3>1.3 Private Messages and Non-Public Communications</h3>
We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example if forum admin is enabled, you can check the "Set Topic Private" checkbox when you create a topic or click on the "Private" button of your topic first post, or use the Private Messages to have non-public conversations. In these cases we will store and process your communications and information related to them. This includes message content, images, information about whom you have communicated with and when to better understand the use of our community, to protect the safety and review the reported messages. We share the content of your Private Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. When you use features like Private Messages to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy of your communications on [forum-name] - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.
